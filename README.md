Apache Traffic Server ingress controller for Kubernetes
=======================================================

**WARNING: This is alpha code, do not use it in production.**

This is a Kubernetes ingress controller plugin for
[Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/), a high-performance,
extensible HTTP proxy server (unrelated to Apache httpd).  The Ingress
controller allows Traffic Server to act as an ingress controller for Kubernetes
clusters, routing incoming requests to pods while providing TLS termination,
caching, ESI and other standard Traffic Server features.

The controller is provided as C source code and as a pre-built Docker image.
If you want to add Kubernetes support to an existing instance of TS, you should
build the plugin from source.  If you want to deploy TS inside a Kubernetes
cluster, you can use the pre-built Docker image.

## Quick start

To deploy the image on an existing Kubernetes 1.6 (or later) cluster:

```sh
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torchbox/k8s-ts-ingress/master/example-rbac.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torchbox/k8s-ts-ingress/master/example-deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will start two copies of Traffic Server, each with an emptyDir volume for
cache storage, listening on node ports 30080 (http) and 30443 (https).   You can
configure an external load balancer of some sort to route incoming traffic to
those ports, or use Kubernetes'
[keepalived-vip](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/keepalived-vip)
to manage a virtual IP address on your cluster.

For more detailed installation and configuration instructions, read the
[documentation](https://torchbox.github.io/k8s-ts-ingress/).
