Apache Traffic Server ingress controller for Kubernetes
=======================================================

**WARNING: This is pre-alpha code, do not use it in production.**

This is a Kubernetes ingress controller plugin for
[Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/).  It allows Traffic
Server to act as an ingress controller for Kubernetes clusters, routing incoming
requests to pods while providing TLS termination, caching, ESI and other standard
Traffic Server features.

This implementation replaces our [previous implementation](https://github.com/torchbox/trafficserver-ingress-controller),
which generated TS `remap.config` configuration using an external script.

The plugin is only supported with Traffic Server 7.0.  It may work with 6.x
versions, but has not been tested.  It definitely won't work with 5.x or older
versions without modifications, as the plugin API has changed.

Building
--------

Requirements:

* A working C compiler and `make` utility.
* json-c library
* OpenSSL (or a compatible TLS library, e.g. LibreSSL)

Build and install the plugin:

```
$ ./configure [--with-tsxs=/path/to/trafficserver/bin/tsxs]
$ make
# make install
```

Configuration
-------------

Run `make install` to install the plugin, or copy the `kubernetes.so` to the
Traffic Server plugin directory (e.g.
`/usr/local/trafficserver/libexec/trafficserver`).  Edit `plugin.config` to
load the plugin.

If Traffic Server is running inside the cluster, no configuration is required;
it will pick up its service account details automatically.

Otherwise, copy `kubernetes.config.example` to the Traffic Server configuration
directory as `kubernetes.config` and edit it for your site. 

TLS
---

TLS keys and certificates are taken from Kubernetes Secret resources according
to the Ingress controller specification.  TLS Server Name Indication support is
required; clients without SNI support will not work.  This is not considered
a deficiency, since all current TLS clients support SNI.

If you don't want to use Kubernetes for TLS, set `tls: false` in
`kubernetes.config`, then configure your own TLS certificates in
`ssl_multicert.config` or though some other mechanism (e.g. the `ssl-cert-loader`
plugin).  In that case, TLS works exactly as it would if Kubernetes was not involved.

Debugging
---------

To debug problems with the plugin, enable the debug tags `kubernetes` (for the
plugin itself) or `watcher` (for the Kubernetes API code).

Docker configuration
--------------------

If you're using the pre-built Docker image, you can set the following environment
variables to configure Traffic Server:

* `TS_CACHE_SIZE`: Size of the on-disk cache file to create, in megabytes.

In addition, any TS configuration (records.config) setting can be
overridden in the environment:

https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html#environment-overrides

For persistent cache storage, mount a volume on `/var/lib/trafficserver`.
This can be a persistent volume or an emptyDir; any missing necessary files,
including the cache store, will be created at startup.

Ingress annotations
-------------------

The behaviour of an Ingress can be configured by setting annotations on the
resource.  The following annotations are supported:

* `ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect`: if `"false"`, do not redirect HTTP
  requests to HTTPS, even if the Ingress has TLS configured.
