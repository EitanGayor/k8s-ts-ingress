# Most of the settings in this file can also be given as environment variables,
# which will override anything set here.

### API server configuration

# connections are supported.  (Environment variable: $TS_SERVER.)
server: apiserver.mycluster.com:8443

# Optional (but recommended): configure the certificate authority to verify the
# API server connection.  (Environment: $TS_CAFILE.)
cafile: /mnt/c/Users/ft/.kube/kube-prod.ca

# Optional: configure the TLS certificate and key to authenticate to the
# API server.  (Environment: $TS_CERTFILE, $TS_KEYFILE.)
certfile: /mnt/c/Users/ft/.kube/kube-prod.crt
keyfile: /mnt/c/Users/ft/.kube/kube-prod.key

# Optional: configure the bearer token to authenticate to the API server.
# (Environment: $TS_TOKEN.)
#token: ABCD1234
